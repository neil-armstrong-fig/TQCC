TQCC returns to the famous Mondello 24hr Race!

## The Event

Following last year's fantastic experience, we're heading back to Mondello Park for another crack at the 24-hour endurance race.

- **Team relay format** — ride in shifts with your teammates
- **Mixed abilities** — groups will be formed to suit different fitness levels
- **Great atmosphere** — one of the best cycling events in Ireland!

## What's Involved

Riders take turns completing laps around the Mondello Park circuit over a 24-hour period. It's as much about team spirit and fun as it is about speed!

Details about team formation, accommodation, and logistics will be shared with interested members soon.
