The ultimate test of your summer fitness — the TQCC Grand Fondo!

## The Challenge

Another tribute to our Italian roots and the legendary Giro d'Italia. But this time, we're going big.

**What to expect:**
- **Longer distance** than our spring Italian ride
- **More climbing** — proper hills to test your legs
- **Summer fitness required** — this is the payoff for all those training miles!

## Route

Full route details will be revealed closer to the event, but prepare for a proper challenge worthy of the Grand Fondo name.

This is for riders who've been building their fitness through the season and want to test themselves on something substantial.

*Forza!* 🚴
