The ultimate test of your summer fitness — the TQCC Grand Fondo!

## The Challenge

Another tribute to our Italian roots and the legendary Giro d'Italia. But this time, we're going big.

**What to expect:**
- **106 miles** of challenging terrain through the Mourne Mountains
- **8,750 feet** of climbing — proper hills to test your legs
- **Epic climbs** including Croob and the legendary Spelga Dam in the heart of the Mournes
- **66+ segments** featuring steep gradients like Burn Rd (12.6% grade) and Drumbuck Road (13.8% grade)
- **Summer fitness required** — this is the payoff for all those training miles!

## Route

The TQCC Anniversary Fondo takes you through some of Northern Ireland's most spectacular cycling terrain. You'll conquer the climb up Croob before tackling the epic Spelga Dam in the Mourne Mountains — a true test of endurance with sustained climbs, technical descents, and diverse segments ranging from short sprints to longer endurance efforts.

This is for riders who've been building their fitness through the season and want to test themselves on something substantial.

*Forza!* 🚴
