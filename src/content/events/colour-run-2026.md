Spring is here! Join us for the annual Colour Run to celebrate the longer evenings ahead.

## The Plan

Each pace group will organize their own route:

- All groups depart from **Titanic Quarter Belfast**
- All groups converge at **The Georgian House in Comber** for lunch
- Routes designed to suit each group's ability

A fantastic way to shake off the winter cobwebs and enjoy some social riding with fellow club members.

See you there!
