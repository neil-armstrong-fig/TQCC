## The Story

While the official Lap The Lough event has been cancelled this year, we're organizing our own club version so members don't miss out on this fantastic route.

## The Route

A complete loop around beautiful Strangford Lough:
- Approximately 53 miles of scenic riding
- Relatively flat terrain
- Stunning coastal views throughout

All the usual pace groups will be organized, so riders of all abilities can enjoy this classic route.

More details including start time and meeting point coming soon!
