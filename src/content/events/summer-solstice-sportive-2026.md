Join us for our annual Summer Solstice Sportive — open to everyone!

## Event Details

- **Evening ride** making the most of the long summer daylight
- **Distance:** Approximately 44 miles
- **Open to non-members** — the only TQCC event where guests can join!
- **All abilities welcome** — we'll have groups for different paces

This is a fantastic opportunity for riders outside the club to experience a TQCC event and enjoy the camaraderie of group riding on one of the longest days of the year.
