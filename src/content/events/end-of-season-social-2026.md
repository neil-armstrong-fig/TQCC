Time to celebrate an incredible year of cycling!

## Join Us

After a fantastic season of rides, events, and adventures together, it's time to hang up the bikes (temporarily!) and enjoy each other's company off the saddle.

## What to Expect

- Good food and drink
- Great company
- Stories and laughs from the season
- Recognition of members' achievements
- A chance to relax before winter training begins!

## Details

Venue and date will be confirmed closer to the event. All members and their families are welcome.

See you there for a well-earned celebration! 🎉
