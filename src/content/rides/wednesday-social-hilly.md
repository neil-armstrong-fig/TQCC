A social-paced hilly ride that combines the friendly atmosphere of the laps with challenging hill work. While maintaining a social pace of 14-16 mph, this ride features more elevation and technical descents, making it more intense than the laps.

**Important**: Better bike handling skills are required for the descents and varied terrain. If you're comfortable on the laps and looking to progress to hillier routes at a sociable pace, this is the perfect next step.

Meeting at SPAR Titanic Quarter at 18:30. Lights required during winter months.
