On a B3 ride, individuals should have the necessary skills for riding in a group environment, but the pace will be slightly slower than that of B2. As riders train and progress they may then be comfortable on the faster and larger group sizes of the B2 rides. B3 weekend rides are often 40 miles, sometimes longer in spring and summer months.

Meeting at SPAR Titanic Quarter in the morning. Check WhatsApp for the week's route and start time.
