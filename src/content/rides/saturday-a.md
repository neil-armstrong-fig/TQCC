The A group is the fastest pace group requiring riders to have an above average skill set for riding in groups under higher physical stress. The A group is not for individuals who have little group riding experience. Weekend rides are often 60 – 70 miles, sometimes longer in spring and summer months.

Meeting at SPAR Titanic Quarter in the morning. Check WhatsApp for the week's route and start time.
