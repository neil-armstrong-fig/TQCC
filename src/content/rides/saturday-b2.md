On a B2 ride, individuals should have the necessary skills for riding in a group environment, but the pace will be slightly slower than that of B1. As riders train and progress they may then be comfortable on the faster B1 rides. B2 weekend rides are often 50 miles, sometimes longer in spring and summer months.

Meeting at SPAR Titanic Quarter in the morning. Check WhatsApp for the week's route and start time.
