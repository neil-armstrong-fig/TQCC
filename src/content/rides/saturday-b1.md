On a B1 ride, individuals should have the necessary riding skills in a group environment like that of the A group, but not at the faster pace. The B1 group is not for individuals who have little group riding experience. Weekend rides are often 50 – 60 miles, sometimes longer in spring and summer months.

Meeting at SPAR Titanic Quarter in the morning. Check WhatsApp for the week's route and start time.
