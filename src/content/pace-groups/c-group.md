The C group is focused on general fitness and intermediate to good riding skills in a group. It is for those with the physical fitness level that allows them to go moderate distances at lower average pace than that of the A or B groups. Riders new to group cycling and those working on developing their skills should start in this group, and in time may progress to the B group.
