          Titanic Quarter Cycling Club was established in November 2014, born out
          of a conversation at the media launch of the Giro d'Italia's Big Start
          in Belfast the year before.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          In 2013, Alex McGreevy and Phil Corr discovered a shared passion for
          cycling at the Giro d'Italia media launch in Belfast. Alex had already
          drawn up a proposal for a cycling club based in the locality where RMS
          Titanic, the world's most famous ship, was constructed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the positive momentum of the Giro to spur on their efforts, Phil
          and Alex were joined by enthusiasts James Loughrey, Colin O'Carroll,
          Julie Beckett, Andrew Davies and Maeve Curran. Each took on roles to
          make TQCC a reality, and the club was officially founded in November
          2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial concept for the club kit was further developed by the new
          committee, and sponsors were sought to support the mobilisation of the
          club.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aims and objectives of the club were simple — to promote Titanic
          Quarter as a shared space for cycling, and to embrace the social,
          leisure and competitive camaraderie of the sport.
        </p>

          Our club kit features <strong>yellow and black colours</strong>,
          referencing the iconic Titanic ship and White Star Line funnels. The
          club badge incorporates industrial heritage imagery alongside the
          modern Titanic Quarter identity.

        <p>
          A distinctive <strong>pink stripe</strong> appears on the left arm and
          shorts, honouring the 2014 Giro d'Italia arrival in Belfast that
          coincided with TQCC's founding.
