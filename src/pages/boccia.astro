        <h2>What is Boccia?</h2>
        <p>
          Boccia is a Paralympic precision ball sport, similar in concept to bowls
          or p&eacute;tanque. Players throw, kick, or use a ramp to propel leather
          balls as close as possible to a white target ball called the
          <strong>jack</strong>. It has been a Paralympic sport since 1984.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sport is designed for athletes with significant physical disabilities
          affecting motor function, including cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy,
          and spinal injuries. Athletes compete while seated and may use assistive
          devices such as ramps to deliver the ball. Boccia can be played
          individually, in pairs, or in teams of three.
        </p>
