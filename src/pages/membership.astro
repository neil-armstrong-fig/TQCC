          <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">New to cycling?</h3>
          <p class="text-tqcc-gray">
            We recommend starting with our <strong>Sunday Scone Run</strong> or
            <strong>Wednesday Evening Laps</strong> — both are relaxed,
            conversational-pace rides perfect for new riders.
            Check our <a href={`${baseUrl}/rides-events`} class="text-tqcc-pink hover:underline">Rides & Events</a>
            page for details.

        <h2>Try Before You Join</h2>
        <p>
          Not sure if club cycling is for you? No problem! We welcome potential
          members to join us for <strong>two taster rides</strong> before
          committing to membership.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since all club members need third party liability insurance (included
          with your Cycling Ireland licence), you'll just need to sign a simple
          form before your taster ride. This ensures you're covered by insurance
          during the group ride, so you can relax and enjoy getting to know the club.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please <a href={`${baseUrl}/contact`} class="text-tqcc-pink hover:underline">contact the club</a> before attending your first taster ride.
          This allows us to arrange the paperwork in advance and ensure you join a ride that matches your experience level.
          We'll guide you through the process and help you choose the best ride to start with!
        </p>

          Safety and respect are at the heart of everything we do. All riders are
          expected to follow basic group riding etiquette:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Arrive on time with your bike in good working order</li>
          <li>Wear a helmet at all times</li>
          <li>Carry spare tubes, pump, and basic tools</li>

          <li>Be friendly and welcoming to new riders</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>About Our Ride Leaders</h2>
        <p>
          Every TQCC group ride is led by a volunteer <strong>Ride Leader (RL)</strong> — an experienced club member who plans and guides the ride. Ride Leaders are the backbone of our club, ensuring every ride is safe, enjoyable, and appropriate for the group's ability level.
        </p>

        <h3>What Ride Leaders Do</h3>
        <p>Before each ride, your Ride Leader will have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Planned a route suitable for the group's experience level</li>
          <li>Considered road conditions, traffic patterns, and the group's target pace</li>
          <li>Prepared to brief riders on the route, expected pace, and group riding signals</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          At the start of the ride, the RL will explain the route, discuss the planned pace, and review the calls and hand signals we use to communicate on the road. They're there to help new riders feel confident and to ensure everyone knows what to expect.
        </p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Understanding the Risks</h3>
          <p class="text-tqcc-gray text-base mb-3">
            While cycling is an outstanding recreational sport, it also involves inherent risks. These include but are not limited to: traveling on or crossing busy roads, winding roads, steep descents, potholes, accidents, unexpected moves by other riders, physical exertion, fatigue, mechanical issues, and interactions with motorists.
          </p>
          <p class="text-tqcc-gray text-base">
            By participating in a TQCC group ride, all riders acknowledge these risks and agree to assume responsibility for their own safety. TQCC officers, committee members, and Ride Leaders are volunteers who organize rides in good faith, and are not liable for any injury or damage resulting from participation in club activities.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Your Safety is Your Responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          Ride Leaders provide guidance and structure, but every rider is ultimately responsible for their own safety. Ride within your abilities, maintain your bike in good working order, and speak up if you're uncomfortable with any aspect of the ride. Our Ride Leaders are here to help, but safe group riding requires the attention and cooperation of everyone on the ride.
        </p>

        <h2>What to Bring</h2>
        <p>
          For your first ride, you'll need:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A road bike in good working condition</li>
