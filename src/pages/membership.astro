        <h2>How to Join</h2>

        <h3 class="flex items-center gap-3">
          <span class="bg-tqcc-yellow text-tqcc-black font-bold rounded-full w-10 h-10 flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0">1</span>
          Join us for a taster ride
        </h3>
        <p>
          As with all cycling clubs, members are required to be covered by third party liability insurance and this is included with a Cycling Ireland licence. Potential members are welcome to come out on <strong>two 'taster rides'</strong> with the club and you can sign a form before the ride which will mean you are covered by insurance during the group ride.
        </p>

        <h3 class="flex items-center gap-3">
          <span class="bg-tqcc-yellow text-tqcc-black font-bold rounded-full w-10 h-10 flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0">2</span>
          Already have a valid Cycling Ireland licence?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you already have a valid Cycling Ireland licence and are 'unattached', you can request a transfer to TQCC. If you're a member of another club, you will need to request a transfer from your current club. Please <a href="mailto:titanicquartercc@gmail.com" class="text-tqcc-pink hover:underline">contact us</a> to arrange your club membership.
        </p>

        <h3 class="flex items-center gap-3">

          Don't have a Cycling Ireland licence?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>We strongly recommend joining via Cycling Ireland to keep things simple.</strong> You can register by clicking the link below (90% of our members hold a 'Leisure Licence').
        </p>
        <p>
          When you register, you will be asked what club you wish to join — select <strong>Titanic Quarter Cycling Club</strong>. You'll pay both the Cycling Ireland licence fee and your TQCC club membership fee together in one transaction via the CI portal.
        </p>

        </p>
        <ul>

        <h2>Before Your First Ride</h2>

        <h3>Ride Etiquette</h3>
        <p>
          Safety and respect are at the heart of everything we do. All riders are
          expected to follow basic group riding etiquette:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Arrive on time with your bike in good working order</li>
          <li>Wear a helmet at all times</li>
          <li>Ride two abreast where safe, single file on busy roads</li>
          <li>Call out hazards and signal turns for the group</li>
          <li>Respect the pace of the group you've joined</li>
          <li>Be friendly and welcoming to new riders</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>About Our Ride Leaders</h3>
        <p>
          Every TQCC group ride is led by a volunteer <strong>Ride Leader (RL)</strong> — an experienced club member who plans and guides the ride. Before each ride, your Ride Leader will have planned a suitable route, considered road conditions and traffic patterns, and prepared a briefing on pace and group riding signals.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start of the ride, the RL will explain the route, discuss the planned pace, and review the calls and hand signals we use to communicate on the road. They're there to help new riders feel confident and to ensure everyone knows what to expect.
        </p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Understanding the Risks</h3>
          <p class="text-tqcc-gray text-base mb-3">
            While cycling is an outstanding recreational sport, it also involves inherent risks. These include but are not limited to: traveling on or crossing busy roads, winding roads, steep descents, potholes, accidents, unexpected moves by other riders, physical exertion, fatigue, mechanical issues, and interactions with motorists.
          </p>
          <p class="text-tqcc-gray text-base">
            By participating in a TQCC group ride, all riders acknowledge these risks and agree to assume responsibility for their own safety. TQCC officers, committee members, and Ride Leaders are volunteers who organize rides in good faith, and are not liable for any injury or damage resulting from participation in club activities.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Your Safety is Your Responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          Ride Leaders provide guidance and structure, but every rider is ultimately responsible for their own safety. Ride within your abilities, maintain your bike in good working order, and speak up if you're uncomfortable with any aspect of the ride. Safe group riding requires the attention and cooperation of everyone on the ride.
